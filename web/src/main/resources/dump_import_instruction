How to export open data to postgre db.

Install db, restore my dump "dump_riga_db" or create tables manually from csv files.

The SQL queries to create scheme:

CREATE TABLE routes
(
  id serial NOT NULL,
  route_id character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  route_short_name character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  route_long_name character varying(255) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT routes_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

For routes prepare routes file, edit it using excel or "CSVed" tool from directory "csveditor"
(open source tool from here https://csved.sjfrancke.nl/).
Remove extra columns, except route_id, route_short_name, route_long_name and save it as csv.
Your should get file like "routes.csv".
Then click on new table in postgre and import your routes file.
For import, select options: import mode, path to file, header "yes" delimiter as comma,
on columns tab, remove id from import, because it does not exists in csv.
Check your table.

Do the same things for next tables (create tables with query, remove extra data from dump files and import them):

CREATE TABLE stops
(
  id serial NOT NULL,
  stop_id character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  stop_name character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  stop_lat double precision NOT NULL,
  stop_lon double precision NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT stops_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE trips
(
  id serial NOT NULL,
  route_id character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  service_id character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  trip_id character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  trip_headsign character varying(255) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT trips_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE validations
(
  id serial NOT NULL,
  Ier_ID character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  Parks character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  TranspVeids character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  GarNr character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  MarsrNos character varying(255) NOT NULL,
  TMarsruts character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  Virziens character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  ValidTalonaId character varying(50) NOT NULL,
  Laiks TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT validations_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
)
